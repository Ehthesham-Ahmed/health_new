    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.</p>
    <p>Any healthy adult, both male and female, can donate blood. A healthy individual can safely donate one unit of blood, that is, 350 ml. Men can donate safely once in every three months while women can donate every four months. However, there are certain factors you need to fulfill to be considered as a donor.</p>
    <h2>Whole blood donation</h2>
    <p>Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components — red cells, plasma and sometimes platelets.</p>
